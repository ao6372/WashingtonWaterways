This is a guide to show where to edit certain parameters in the code for this project.

NetCDFDataClean.py
function=This file takes NetCDF files and turns them into dataframes to be
compatible for the rest of the computation/models. It converts data from the UW
atmospheric science database.

line 6  - main function has a filepath that you can change to clean netcdf
          on different locations saved
line 19 -the first file I worked with included dates that were from 1950 so
          I filtered for 1985 and on. You can change the dates or get rid of
          this line if it is unnecessary.
line 81 -This takes the top ONE value per year in a dataframe. If you want to
          consider a different amount of values per water year, I have left code
          example for 30 values per water year.

scraping UW database portion
line 112-this is an example of baselinks. You can change baselinks depending
          on the location of the model in URL form.
          The linklist portion has a parse to start from 5 and on because that
          page started to show link information after the 5th item in the list.
          If you are using this for another baselink, consider checking the
          linklist parse. The data also is limited to 198510 and beyond (change
          if necessary).
